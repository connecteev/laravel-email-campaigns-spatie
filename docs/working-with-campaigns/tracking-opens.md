The package can track when and how many times a subscriber opens a campaign.

## Enabling open tracking

To use this feature, you must set `track_opens` to `true` of a campaign you're going to send. You can find an example of how to do this in the section on [how to create a campaign](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-email-campaigns/v1/working-with-campaigns/creating-a-campaign/).

## How it works under the hood

When you send a campaign that has open tracking enabled, we'll add a web beacon to it.  A web beacon is an extra `img` tag in the HTML of your mail.  Its `src` attribute points to an endpoint added by the route macro, `Route::emailCampaigns` that you added when installing the package.

 Here's an example of what the web beacon looks like:

```html
<img src="https://yourapp.com/email-campaigns/track-opens/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" />
```

The last segment of the link contains the UUID of an `EmailSend` model. An `EmailSend` represents a mail that has been sent for a campaign and contains a relation to a subscriber.

Each time an email client tries to display the web beacon it will send a get request to the `Spatie\EmailCampaigns\Http\Controllers\TrackOpensController`.

## Queuing open tracking

When sending a campaign to a large list, that endpoint could be hit a lot over a short timespan. To ensure a very fast response time, we don't do any database updates in the controller itself. Instead, the controller will dispatch a `TrackOpenJob`.

Because there's the potential for a great many of these jobs to be scheduled, we recommend using a separate queue for handling them. You can configure the queue to be used in the `perform_on_queue.register_open_job` key of the `email-campaigns` config file.
